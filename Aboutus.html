   ABOUT US
</strong>


</span>
</h1>

<p>
    We believe artists should be respected and fairly rewarded for their work, so we’re building a place that aims to actively promote value, honesty and transparency in music, something we hope every musician and creative talent can feel part of.

More and more artists are self-releasing and enjoying success without the need for a record label deal, and this is made possible due to the tools available to independent musicians. </p>
<p>
Every musician and creative, at any stage of their music career, relies on multiple tools and services to manage the various tasks needed to succeed in today’s digital music environment.

This includes releasing music, collecting royalties, selling merchandise, finding gigs, getting in front of new (and existing) fans, collecting fan data, staying socially active and a whole load more.

As a result, we believe the digital music industry has become overcrowded, and for many it’s overwhelming and inconvenient to keep track of all the tools available, not to mention the multiple logins and individual costs. </p>
